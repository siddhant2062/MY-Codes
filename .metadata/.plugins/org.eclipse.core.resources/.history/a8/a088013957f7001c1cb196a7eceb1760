// java supports a special type of method called constructor for initializing an object when it is created. This is known as automatic initialization of objects. A class constructor if defined is called whenever a program creates an object of that class.
//They are invoked directly when an object is created.
//They don't have return type, not even void and hence can't return any values.
//A constructor should have the same name as the class.
//They can't be inherited. Only members are inherited, and a constructor is not considered as a member.
