//a class describes the contents of the objects that belong to it: it describes an aggregate of data fields (called instance variables), and defines the operations (called methods). object: an object is an element (or instance) of a class; objects have the behaviors of their class.

/*Java is an object-oriented programming language. ... For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.
  
A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects*/

//in simple words we can say, objects are instance(उदाहरण) of class or we can say each object of a class has its own copy of data members defined in the class.
